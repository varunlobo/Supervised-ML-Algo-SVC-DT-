# supervised machine learning algorithm using Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Decision Tree (DT)

Demonstration of the use of Support vector classification (SVC) and Decision tree (DT) to classify images.



In this notebook we download the digits dataset to classify 8x8 images into 10 classes. Each digit is labelled from 0 to 9. The object of this exercise is to train two machine learning algorithms, SVC & DT to classify these classes.
